# Pizza Sales Power BI Visualization
Hello there! I am excited to present the results of my Pizza Sales Data Analysis project. I explored a comprehensive dataset containing detailed information about pizza orders, including order details, pizza category, size, quantity, prices, and order dates.

## Problem Statement
The pizza store aims to understand key aspects of its sales data to optimize its business strategies. Some of the specific questions we seek to address are:

- What is the total revenue generated from pizza sales?
- What is the average order value for pizza purchases?
- How many pizzas have been sold in total?
- How many unique orders have been placed?
- What is the average number of pizzas sold per order?

Additionally, we will explore trends related to daily and monthly sales, sales distribution across different pizza categories and sizes, and number of orders.
